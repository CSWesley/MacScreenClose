# Mac Screen Close

## Description
This was a simple tool made by me and is essentially useless. It restricts several default
Mac tools, like Mission Control and pretty much everything else. You can close it with
Command + Q.

It was specifically made for my own use, but you may find some use for it.

The password is "e", so you can't close it without that (or Command + Q).

Why did I do all this for a personal tool?

## Installation
