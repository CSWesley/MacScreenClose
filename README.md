# Mac Screen Close

## Description
This was a simple tool made by me and is essentially useless. It restricts several default
Mac tools, like Mission Control and pretty much everything else. You can close it with
Command + Q.

It was specifically made for my own use, but you may find some use for it.

The password is "e", so you can't close it without that (or Command + Q).

## Installation
#### Method 1
You can use:

`git clone https://github.com/CSWesley/MacScreenClose`

Then, you can go into the src folder and run: (You will need to have Java installed)

`java -jar MacScreenClose.jar`

#### Method 2

You can directly download the .zip file from the GitHub repo which contains the .pkg file.

(Add this soon)
